# Triangle Lab

In this lab you will
- Use a constructor to set instance variables
- Implement return methods
- Test and debug your code

## About the Triangle Class
This class will store the lengths for each of the side measures of a Triangle. The class will then calculate the perimeter and the area of the given triangle. 

First, implement the constructor on Line 13 so that the instance variables are all initalized. 

Next, complete the `getPerimeter` and `getArea` methods so they return the correct calculation. 

Test cases are provided in the comments in `Main.java`.
